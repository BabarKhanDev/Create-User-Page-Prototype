# Create-User-Page-Prototype

This prototype allows users to input a username and select a profile picture from a predefined selection. 
I wanted to create this as it will be used in a future game I am making, and figured it'd be easier to make each page separately and then bring it all together.
There are no passwords as the game is only ever ran locally and uses IP Addresses to verify users. This would never work over the internet and would need a different solution if I did, but that would only have to be some other unique identifier per user.
  
The images are very large, but I figured that was fine because any users are going to be on my wifi while playing, if the game were run over the internet then I would shrink them to 250x250 images, in testing this brought them to 10s of KB and would have been much more suitable for users on mobile data.
